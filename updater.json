    "notes": "## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-22  ### Added - **🎵 LastFM Bio Sync**: Dynamic bio integration with the Last.fm API — the app now automatically updates your League profile bio with the song you are currently listening to.  ### Changed - **⚡ App Architecture**: Refactored the root `App` component to reduce Cognitive Complexity from 22 to under 15, improving maintainability and readability.  ### Fixed - **🔒 Security (CodeQL)**: Resolved incomplete URL substring sanitization warnings flagged by CodeQL analysis. - **♿ Accessibility**: Associated all form labels with their controls across all tabs; added accessible text to icon-only switch labels; added full keyboard accessibility to remaining interactive elements. - **🔧 Code Quality**: Replaced all `role='button'` divs with semantic native `<button>` elements; removed unnecessary `as any` type assertions; replaced `String#replace` with `String#replaceAll` where appropriate; switched timer globals from `window` to `globalThis`. - **📋 Logs**: Resolved React key warning caused by array index usage in the logs list. - **⚠️ Exception Handling**: Improved error handling in the rank override flow.  ### Testing - **🧪 Unit Tests**: Added comprehensive test suite for all tabs and hooks, reaching 80%+ code coverage to satisfy SonarCloud quality gate.  ### Removed - **🗑️ Cleanup**: Deleted `test-auto-close.bat` and `sync_labels.ps1` development-only scripts no longer needed.  ---  ",
